Chrome Extension that:

1) counts the number of birds on each webpage you visit
    & displays the count of birds by page in a new tab when the extension is clicked
2) redirects from any page with the word bird on it to [birdsarentreal.com](http://birdsarentreal.com) (duh)
3) pops up an import PSA on [birdsarentreal.com](http://birdsarentreal.com) 

Next steps:

1) Make Birds Extension in Mozilla via Webext (test in Safari too)
2) Learn to make an app with React in a browser extension
3) Make a beginner/hello-world-esque extension that reminds people to actually foster meaningful connections with friends every time they visit a social media site
4) Make an extension that that yells at you when you're distracted when you want to work.
    Accepts:
        1) Time range to be working
        2) A list of URLs to block
        3) A "take a break" button
        4) A "disable the break button" button
